# Bake-off results

InterCode-ALFA, unmodified scorer, 300 tasks per set. Fixed settings, stated
with every number: temperature 0, `n_predict` 64, embed threshold 0.75,
`repeat_penalty` 1.08 / `repeat_last_n` 64, GBNF single-line grammar — the
same settings `internal/engine` sends. Seed 42. BM set is the colloquial
translation in `dataset/eval_bm_300.jsonl`; EN set is the untouched
NL2SH-ALFA test split, kept as the regression control.

| run | training pool | epochs | BM pass | EN pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| nl2sh-1.5b (shipping today) | whatisit's 125,770 English pairs | — | 0.297 | **0.593** |
| 1 | NL2SH-ALFA + tldr, 70,356 pairs | 2 | 0.387 | 0.493 |
| 2 | NL2SH-ALFA only, 40,938 pairs | 2 | 0.410 | 0.457 |
| 3 | NL2SH-ALFA + tldr, 70,356 pairs | 1 | **0.440** | 0.507 |

All tunes are Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct, LoRA r32/a64/dropout 0.05,
all-linear, 2e-4 cosine 3% warmup, seq 512, effective batch 32, bf16, seed 42.
Every pair contributes four rows (formal, colloquial, rojak, English).

Run 3 against the untuned base, paired exact McNemar:

- BM: +0.143 (89 -> 132 of 300), 26 lost / 69 gained, **p = 1.2e-05**
- EN: -0.086 (178 -> 152 of 300), 50 lost / 24 gained, **p = 0.0034**

## What the runs establish

Malay accuracy is settled: every tune beats the shipping model by a wide,
significant margin, and run 3 lifts it by half again. English is the open
problem — no tune has matched the base's 0.593.

Two levers moved it, and the first hypothesis was wrong:

**tldr was innocent.** Run 2 dropped it on the theory that its uniform
one-page-per-tool shape flattened the tool-frequency distribution. English
got *worse* (0.493 -> 0.457), so the mix was not the cause.

**Epochs were half the story.** Four registers per command means one epoch is
already four exposures of every command; the inherited "2 epochs" was set for
one-row-per-command data. Run 2 reached a lower training loss (0.437 vs
0.542) on less data and scored worse on both sets — overfitting, confirmed by
the failure mode: the model invents memorised path prefixes
(`cat /home/tecmint/scripts/setup.sh` for a bare filename). Halving to one
epoch lifted both scores (run 1 -> run 3).

**Pool size is the other half.** English tracks it monotonically across every
run: 40,938 pairs -> 0.457, 70,356 -> 0.493/0.507, and the base's 125,770 ->
0.593. Our English register is one row in four, so a 70k pool carries 70k
English examples against the base's 125,770.

Run 4 combines both: 86,409 pairs (commandlinefu and git-instruction added,
`dataset/extra_sources.py`) at one epoch.
